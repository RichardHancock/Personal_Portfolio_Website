		<p>
			SECTION REQUIRES BETTER WORDING &amp; RESTRUCTURING!<br>
			I have been programming for several years, and since 2011 I have been studying to take up programming as a career. During this time
			I have learned several programming languages to a basic proficiency, these include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Python - I am using python in a Udacity CompSci course, which I am in the process of completing.</li>
			<li>HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP - I have made many websites using these languages which are available to view ADD LINK HERE</li>
			<li>Visual Basic - I have made several programs during college, most of which can be seen ADD LINK HERE</li>
			<li>Java - I know the basic syntax and have made simple OOP code snippets</li>
			<li>C++ - I have just started learning this language, as I will be using it extensively at University.
		</ul>
		<p>
			I am about to start BSc Games Programming at Bournemouth University, which lasts 4 years.
